- Filtering by category (Food, Shelter, Mental Health, Crisis Support, etc.)
- Working on both mobile and desktop for easy access anywhere

- People in need of basic support (food, housing, crisis response)
- Teens, students, and families in underserved areas
- Teachers, counselors, nonprofits, and outreach workers
